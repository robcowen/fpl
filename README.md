<p>This app generates a graph of your Fantasy Premier League's performance over the season.</p>
<p>To make it work, simply enter the URL https://fpl-graph.herokuapp.com/[league_code], replacing [league_code] with the league code, obviously. This can be obtained by signing into FPL and browsing to your league: the code is in the URL: https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/[league_code]/standings/c</p>
<p>Note: It will only return a limited number of players for larger leagues, as it doesn't yet incorporate pagination from the API.</p>
